# Weather-App

## AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.

1-GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

2-WHEN I search for a city

3-THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

4-WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

5-THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

6-WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

7-THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

8-WHEN I click on a city in the search history

9-THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
